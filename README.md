#### Responsive Design Using Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI, and React JSX
Creating a responsive design for the Event Management Website using Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI, and React JSX involves leveraging the utility-first approach provided by these frameworks and libraries. Here's a guide on how to achieve a responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices:

#### Set Up Tailwind CSS with DaisyUI
`npm install tailwindcss daisyui
`

Then, configure Tailwind CSS by creating a tailwind.config.js file and importing DaisyUI:

`// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  content: [
    './src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
    './public/index.html',
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [
    require('daisyui'),
  ],
}
`

Run the Tailwind CSS build process:

'
`npx tailwindcss build src/styles.css -o src/output.css
`
#### Use Tailwind CSS Classes in React JSX
Utilize Tailwind CSS classes directly in your React JSX components to style and structure the UI for responsiveness

#### Implement Responsive Classes
Tailwind CSS provides responsive classes for handling different screen sizes. For example, you can use `md:` prefix for styles that apply from medium screens and up, and `lg:` for large screens and up.

#### By following these steps and utilizing the utility-first approach of Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI within React JSX components, you can achieve a responsive design that caters to desktop, tablet, and mobile devices effectively.
